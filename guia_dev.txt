        "For those who have this problem, the solution that I found is setting classpath 3.3.0 and Gradle 4.10.1 as already mentioned, to do this I changed the class path in android/build.gradle in dependencies tag now is like this classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0' and changed the gradle version in android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties to this

        distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.10.1-all.zip

        and in the android/app/build.gradle I added this

        missingDimensionStrategy 'react-native-camera', 'general' in defaultConfig

        And i also added these two lines

        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" } 
        maven { url "https://maven.google.com" } 
        in repositories tag of android/build.gradle

        And then I could use the camera normally"
